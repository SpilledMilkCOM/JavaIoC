# â˜• JavaIoC

Inversion of Control container for Java.  The goal of this project is to mimic _(somewhat)_ the .NET `ServiceCollection` IoC container.

## For VS Code

  * See [references](#ðŸ“š-references) for installs.
  * Don't forget to set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
  * Also put the installation\bin folder in your `PATH` environment variable.
  * Don't forget to set your **maven.executable.path** to the Maven executable _(not really a path)_
    * **Ex:** `C:\_Source\Repos\apache-maven-3.9.5\bin\mvn`

## ðŸ“ƒ TODO

* Look at "scoped"
* Detect recursion
* Fix a bunch of style-check issues _(maybe)_
